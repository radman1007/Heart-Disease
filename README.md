# Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a machine learning model developed using Python to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The model uses a variety of features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other clinical measurements to determine the risk of heart disease.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, normalized, and processed using `pandas` and `numpy` for optimal model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations are created using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to explore relationships between variables and the target outcome (heart disease presence).
- **Model Training**: Different machine learning algorithms are tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors) to find the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains various health metrics, including:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

These features are used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. The dataset is cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed before feeding it into the machine learning models.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
  - `seaborn`: For creating detailed statistical plots.
  - `matplotlib`: For generating visualizations and charts.
  - `scikit-learn`: For model building, training, and evaluation.
